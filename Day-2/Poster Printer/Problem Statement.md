# Problem Statement
A printing press in DiceCity uses a special machine to print colors on blank sheets of paper. The machine operates on pairs of neighboring sheets and can print in one of two color combinations:

"BR": Changes two neighboring blank sheets to blue (B) and red (R).
"RB": Changes two neighboring blank sheets to red (R) and blue (B).
Each operation of the machine modifies the colors of the two adjacent sheets beneath it.

## Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the sequence that is to be printed.

The second line of each test case contains a string s denoting the sequence of colors that is to be printed on the sheets. It is guaranteed that the length of s is N and that s only consists of the characters W, R, and B.

## Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if the target sequence can be printed, or "NO" if it cannot be.

## Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

## Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
2
3
RBR
1
B
Testcase Output
YES
NO
## Explanation
Testcase 1: The sequence "RBB" can be achieved as follows:
Print "RB" on sheets 1 and 2 → Result: RBW
Print "BR" on sheets 2 and 3 → Result: RBR

Testcase 2: It is impossible to achieve a single "B" starting from all white sheets using the machine as it requires at least one "R" for the machine to print "B".

## Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
2
5
BRBBW
3
BRB
Testcase Output
YES
YES
## Explanation
Testcase 1: Starting with all sheets as 'W', the sequence "BRBBW" can be achieved by printing the machine in the following steps:


Print "BR" on sheets 1 and 2 → Result: BRWWW
Print "RB" on sheets 2 and 3 → Result: BRRBW
Print "RB" on sheets 3 and 4 → Result: BRRBW
Print "RB" on sheets 4 and 5 → Result: BRBBW

Testcase 2: The sequence "BRB" can be achieved by printing the machine as follows:


Print "BR" on sheets 1 and 2 → Result: BRW
Print "RB" on sheets 2 and 3 → Result: BRB
