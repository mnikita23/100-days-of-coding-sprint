# Problem Statement
You are given two binary strings a and b, where the length of string a is less than or equal to the length of string b. Your task is to find the total number of differing bits when string a is compared with every possible substring of b that is of the same length as a. A bit is considered different if the corresponding bits in the same positions of a and the substring of b are not equal.

## Input Format
The first line of input consists of string a.

The second line of input consists of string b.

## Output Format
Print a single line of output consisting of the total sum after comparing the bits.

## Constraints
1<= a.length <= b.length<= 2 * 105

## Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
01
00111
Testcase Output
3
## Explanation
The substrings of b of length 2 (length of a) are: '00', '01', '11', '11'

Comparing a = 01 with each substring:
01 vs 00 has 1 differing bits.
01 vs 01 has 0 differing bit.
01 vs 11 has 1 differing bit.
01 vs 11 has 1 differing bit.
Total differing bits = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3

## Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
101
11001
Testcase Output
4
## Explanation
The substrings of b of length 3 (length of a) are: 110, 100, and 001.
Comparing a = 101 with each substring:
101 vs 110 has 2 differing bits.
101 vs 100 has 1 differing bit.
101 vs 001 has 1 differing bit.
Total differing bits = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
